# ContextMenu-Editor
Everything to edit your registry!

The project tries to be as simple as possible while giving the ability
to add a program to mouse right-click menu in windows,
also providing the way to delete what is added

in Menu (mod 1) selection, it adds the context as a sub-menu with etries
for both normal and administration start.

in Entry (mod2) selection, it adds the context directly to menu,
but one needs to press "shift + right click" in an empty area to get to see it.
